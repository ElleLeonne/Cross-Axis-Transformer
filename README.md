The code associated with my cross-axis transformer project.

The results of my last two years of private study, research, and code curation. All work described below was performed either solo, or with the help of chatbot assistants.

The model is novel and was theorized, designed, and coded by hand.
The trainer was built by hand on top of the Lightning codebase.
The attached paper was written in latex by hand.

AI was used for the initial learning of latex, however the contents of the paper were written solo and is not AI generated in any capacity.
